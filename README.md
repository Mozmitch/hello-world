# hello-world
This is where my programming journey, all you good Samaritans rush to my rescue when needed

Mozmitch or should I just call myself Brezovich. Names aside, I'm a programing novice ready to learn and learn and learn and learn. Guess that is too much leaning to do. I love working with data and doing analysis and now I just plunged myself into the world of programming. Help me God.
